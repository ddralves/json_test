# json_test

Assessment test used to conduct research into my JSON and iOS capabilities.

## Functionality

The single paged allows you to:

1. Display list of user's names in a UIAlertController
2. Find and display e-mail for username "Samantha"
3. _Extra Feature_: Ability to search user list for e-mails linked to a supplied username

## Features

The app will only request a fetch of data if and when the data list is empty.

The app will automatically fetch data if user list is empty and a search is requested
